Add music files
==========================

Here you can add music files like adding your songs manually into steamapps/common/Cities_Skylines/CSLMusicMod_Music.

In this folder you can either just drop the music files, which will automatically create a radio channel for you or you can define stations manually.
See the documentation in https://github.com/rumangerst/CSLMusicMod/wiki for all information you need.
